Milestone1:

[x] Functionality

[x] Color ranges for nodes based on attributes

Scaling node size to label

Firing the network and constructing its state after, including activity of transitions
Reloading a network



Milestone2:

Reversing to a former state(?)(useful to show changes quick)

Adding additional input formats




Milestone3:

Liveness of transitions and the hole net

Reachability(graph?)

Boundedness


(hard to calculate probably, maybe impossible):

Fastest ways to state/token in a certain place

something with p- and t-invariants

maximal common transition sets

T-Clusters -> different cluster methods



Misc.
