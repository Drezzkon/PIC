Milestone1:

[x] Functionality

[x] Labels for places based on token amount
[x] Correcting Node Shapes
[x] Firing the network and constructing its state after, including activity of transitions
[x] Reloading a network
[x] Firing several times



Milestone2:

[x] Resetting network
[x] Adding additional input formats
Saving petri net -> what format?
[x] getters for different node types




Milestone3: (Which of these can Cytoscape already do on its own?)
Liveness of transitions and the whole net

Reachability(graph?)

Boundedness


(hard to calculate probably, maybe impossible):

Fastest ways to state/token in a certain place

something with p- and t-invariants

maximal common transition sets

T-Clusters -> different cluster methods



Misc.
